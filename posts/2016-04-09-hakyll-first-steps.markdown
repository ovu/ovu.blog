I am really happy to start writing and even more to write something about hakyll.

I was looking for a tool to generate static html content to publish my blog and I found some alternatives,
I think the most famous is jekyll. It is a tool written in ruby that does exactly that, it generates static content.
However, I found a really good alternative called hakyll, which is a a tool written in haskell that offers a DSL 
to define rules to generate html. 

I decided to use Hakyll because I wanted to practice some haskell and to use as well a serious project written in haskell.

My goal is to write my posts in markdown and to transform the files into html and to host the content in github.
This first steps is what I am going to describe in this post.
