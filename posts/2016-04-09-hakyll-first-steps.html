<p>I am really happy to start writing and even more to write something about hakyll.</p>
<p>I was looking for a tool to generate static html content to publish my blog and I found some alternatives, I think the most famous is jekyll. It is a tool written in ruby that does exactly that, it generates static content. However, I found a really good alternative called hakyll, which is a a tool written in haskell that offers a DSL to define rules to generate html.</p>
<p>I decided to use Hakyll because I wanted to practice some haskell and to use as well a serious project written in haskell.</p>
<p>My goal is to write my posts in markdown and to transform the files into html and to host the content in github. This first steps is what I am going to describe in this post.</p>
